            It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat
            reading a map. For
            a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again. There
            was a
            tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been
            thinking of?
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the
            road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at
            the
            sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his
            mind.
            As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
        </p>
        <p>
            But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual
            morning
            traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.
            People
            in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young
            people!
            He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
            close
            by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t
            young
            at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!
